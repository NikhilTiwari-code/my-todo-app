## 🔧 How It Works (Step by Step)

### **1️⃣ DATABASE MODEL** (`src/models/story.models.ts`)

**Purpose:** Defines how a story is stored in MongoDB

```javascript
Story Schema:
├── userId         → Who posted the story
├── content        → Text content (optional)
├── imageUrl       → Image in base64 format (optional)
├── type           → "text" | "image" | "both"
├── views[]        → Array of user IDs who viewed it
├── expiresAt      → Auto-delete after 24 hours
└── createdAt      → When it was posted
```

**Key Features:**
- ✅ **Auto-expiry**: Stories automatically expire after 24 hours
- ✅ **View tracking**: Knows who viewed each story
- ✅ **Three types**: Text-only, Image-only, or Both

**Static Methods:**
```javascript
getActiveStories()    → Get all stories that haven't expired
getUserStories(id)    → Get all stories from one user
deleteExpired()       → Delete all stories older than 24hrs
```

---

### **2️⃣ API ROUTE: Create & Fetch Stories** (`src/app/api/stories/route.ts`)

#### **GET /api/stories** - Fetch All Active Stories

**What it does:**
1. Gets the logged-in user's ID
2. Finds all stories that haven't expired (< 24 hours old)
3. Groups stories by user
4. Marks which stories you've already viewed
5. Returns list of users with their stories

**Response:**
```json
{
  "stories": [
    {
      "user": {
        "_id": "123",
        "name": "John",
        "avatar": "..."
      },
      "stories": [...],
      "hasViewed": false  ← Did you view any of their stories?
    }
  ]
}
```

#### **POST /api/stories** - Create New Story

**What it does:**
1. Receives: content (text), imageUrl (base64), type
2. Sets expiry time to 24 hours from now
3. Saves story to database
4. Gets your follower list
5. Returns the story + followers (for socket notifications)

**Request:**
```json
{
  "content": "Hello world!",
  "imageUrl": "data:image/png;base64,...",
  "type": "both"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "story": {...},
  "followers": ["userId1", "userId2"]  ← Who to notify
}
```

---

### **3️⃣ API ROUTE: View Story** (`src/app/api/stories/[id]/route.ts`)

#### **GET /api/stories/[id]** - Get Single Story

**What it does:**
1. Finds story by ID
2. Populates user info (name, avatar)
3. Returns the story

#### **POST /api/stories/[id]** - Mark Story as Viewed

**What it does:**
1. Finds the story
2. Checks if you already viewed it
3. If not, adds your ID to the views array
4. Returns updated story

**Request:**
```json
{} (empty - just POST to the endpoint)
```

---

### **4️⃣ API ROUTE: Cleanup** (`src/app/api/stories/cleanup/route.ts`)

#### **DELETE /api/stories/cleanup** - Delete Expired Stories

**What it does:**
1. Finds all stories older than 24 hours
2. Deletes them from database
3. Returns count of deleted stories

**Response:**
```json
{
  "deletedCount": 5
}
```

**Note:** You can run this manually or set up a cron job!

---

### **5️⃣ UI COMPONENT: Story Upload** (`src/components/stories/StoryUpload.tsx`)

**Purpose:** Modal to create a new story

**Features:**
- 📝 Text input field
- 📷 Image upload button (converts to base64)
- 🎨 Three type buttons: Text Only, Image Only, Both
- ✅ Validation (must have text or image)
- 📡 Socket notification to followers

**Flow:**
1. User clicks "Add Story" button
2. Modal opens
3. User types text and/or uploads image
4. Clicks "Post Story"
5. Converts image to base64
6. Sends to API
7. Emits socket event: `story:new` to notify followers
8. Modal closes

**Key Code:**
```javascript
// Convert image to base64
const reader = new FileReader();
reader.onloadend = () => {
  setImagePreview(reader.result as string);
};

// Post story
const res = await fetch("/api/stories", {
  method: "POST",
  body: JSON.stringify({ content, imageUrl, type })
});

// Notify followers
socket?.emit("story:new", {
  storyId: data.story._id,
  userId: user.id,
  userName: user.name,
  followers: data.followers
});
```

---

### **6️⃣ UI COMPONENT: Story Viewer** (`src/components/stories/StoryViewer.tsx`)

**Purpose:** Instagram-style full-screen story viewer

**Features:**
- 📊 Progress bars at top (one per story)
- ⏱️ Auto-advance after 5 seconds
- 👈 Tap left side → Previous story
- 👉 Tap right side → Next story
- ❌ Close button
- 👁️ Auto-marks story as viewed

**Flow:**
1. User clicks on someone's story ring
2. Viewer opens full-screen
3. Shows first story
4. Progress bar fills over 5 seconds
5. Auto-advances to next story
6. When done, closes automatically
7. Sends view count to API

**Key Code:**
```javascript
// Auto-advance timer
useEffect(() => {
  const timer = setInterval(() => {
    setProgress((prev) => {
      if (prev >= 100) {
        handleNext(); // Go to next story
        return 0;
      }
      return prev + (100 / 50); // 5 seconds = 50 intervals
    });
  }, 100);
}, [currentIndex]);

// Mark as viewed
await fetch(`/api/stories/${story._id}`, {
  method: "POST"
});
```

---

### **7️⃣ UI COMPONENT: Story Ring** (`src/components/stories/StoryRing.tsx`)

**Purpose:** Avatar with gradient ring indicator

**Features:**
- 🎨 **Gradient ring** if user has stories
- 🔵 **Blue gradient** = unviewed stories
- ⚪ **Gray ring** = all stories viewed
- 📏 Three sizes: small (sm), medium (md), large (lg)

**Visual:**
```
┌─────────────────┐
│  🟣🟣🟣🟣🟣  │ ← Gradient ring (unviewed)
│  🟣     🟣  │
│  🟣 👤  🟣  │ ← User avatar
│  🟣     🟣  │
│  🟣🟣🟣🟣🟣  │
└─────────────────┘
```

**Props:**
```typescript
<StoryRing
  avatar="https://..."         // User avatar URL
  name="John"                  // User name
  size="lg"                    // sm | md | lg
  hasStory={true}              // Show gradient ring?
  hasUnviewedStory={true}      // Blue or gray ring?
/>
```

---

### **8️⃣ MAIN PAGE** (`src/app/(dashboard)/stories/page.tsx`)

**Purpose:** Main stories feed page (like Instagram stories screen)

**Layout:**
```
┌────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Stories                               │ ← Header
├────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                        │
│  [+]   [👤]  [👤]  [👤]  [👤]  [👤]  │ ← Story rings
│  Add   John  Jane Mike  Sara  Alex   │
│ Story                                  │
│                                        │
└────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Flow:**
1. Loads all active stories from API
2. Shows YOUR story first (or "Add Story" button)
3. Shows all other users' stories
4. Blue ring = unviewed, Gray ring = viewed
5. Click ring → Opens StoryViewer
6. Click "Add" → Opens StoryUpload modal

**Key Code:**
```javascript
// Load stories
const loadStories = async () => {
  const res = await fetch("/api/stories");
  const data = await res.json();
  setUserStories(data.stories);
};

// Your story vs others
const myStories = userStories.find(us => us.user._id === user?.id);

// Filter others
const otherStories = userStories.filter(us => us.user._id !== user?.id);
```

### **9️⃣ REAL-TIME NOTIFICATIONS** (Socket.io Integration)

**Updated:** `socket-server.js`

**What it does:**
When someone posts a story, their followers get notified instantly!

**Flow:**
1. User posts story
2. Frontend emits: `socket.emit("story:new", { storyId, userId, followers })`
3. Socket server receives event
4. Server emits to all followers: `socket.to(followerId).emit("story:new", {...})`
5. Followers see notification: "John posted a new story!"

**Code:**
```javascript
// In StoryUpload.tsx (after posting)
socket?.emit("story:new", {
  storyId: data.story._id,
  userId: user.id,
  userName: user.name,
  followers: data.followers
});

// In socket-server.js
socket.on("story:new", (data) => {
  data.followers.forEach((followerId) => {
    io.to(followerId).emit("story:new", {
      storyId: data.storyId,
      userId: data.userId,
      userName: data.userName
    });
  });
});
```

## ⚡ Technical Decisions

### **Why Base64 for Images?**
- ✅ **Speed of development**: No external setup needed
- ✅ **No API keys**: Works immediately
- ✅ **Self-contained**: Everything in one database
- ⚠️ **Limitation**: Not ideal for production scale
- 🔄 **Future**: Easy to migrate to Cloudinary later

### **Why 24-Hour Auto-Delete?**
- ✅ **Instagram standard**: Users expect stories to disappear
- ✅ **Database efficiency**: Keeps DB size manageable
- ✅ **Privacy**: Old content doesn't linger
- ✅ **Engagement**: Creates urgency to view

### **Why Socket.io Notifications?**
- ✅ **Real-time**: Followers notified instantly
- ✅ **No polling**: Efficient, no constant API calls
- ✅ **Scalable**: Works for 1 or 1000 users
- ✅ **User experience**: Feels alive and interactive

## 🐛 Important Notes

### **Current Limitations:**
1. **Everyone's stories visible**: Right now ALL users' stories show up
   - **Future fix**: Filter by following/followers only

2. **Base64 storage**: Images stored in database as text
   - **Future fix**: Migrate to Cloudinary for better performance

3. **No story replies**: Can't reply to stories yet
   - **Future feature**: Add reply → DM feature

4. **Manual cleanup**: Expired stories need manual deletion
   - **Future fix**: Add cron job for auto-cleanup

### **Database Structure:**
```javascript
Story Document Example:
{
  _id: "64f8a9b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0",
  userId: "user123",
  content: "Having a great day! 🌟",
  imageUrl: "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANS...",
  type: "both",
  views: ["user456", "user789"],
  expiresAt: "2025-10-16T15:30:00.000Z",  // 24 hours from creation
  createdAt: "2025-10-15T15:30:00.000Z"
}
```

## 🎓 Key Concepts Explained

### **Base64 Encoding:**
```
Image File → Binary Data → Base64 String
```
- Converts image to text string
- Can be stored directly in database
- No need for file storage service
- Example: `data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANS...`

### **MongoDB TTL (Time-To-Live):**
```javascript
expiresAt: { type: Date, index: { expires: 0 } }
```
- MongoDB automatically deletes documents when expiresAt is reached
- No manual cleanup needed (but can also do manual cleanup)
- Great for temporary data like stories

### **Socket.io Events:**
```
Client → Emit → Server → Broadcast → Other Clients
```
- Real-time bidirectional communication
- Perfect for notifications
- Follows publish-subscribe pattern
