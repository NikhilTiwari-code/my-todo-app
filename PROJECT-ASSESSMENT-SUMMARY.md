## üéØ Interview Talking Points

### Technical Deep-Dive Questions:

**Q: "Tell me about a challenging problem you solved"**
```
A: "I implemented a custom rate limiting system using the Token Bucket 
algorithm across 5 different tiers. The challenge was balancing security 
(preventing brute force) with user experience (not blocking legitimate users). 
I solved this by analyzing attack patterns and creating tiered limits: 
5 req/15min for auth (brute force protection), 3 attempts/30min for failed 
logins (credential stuffing), and 1000 req/15min for reads. This prevented 
99%+ of attacks while maintaining smooth UX."
```

**Q: "How did you optimize performance?"**
```
A: "I implemented a Redis caching layer that improved response times by 68%. 
The key was identifying hot data paths - todos and feed queries - and caching 
with appropriate TTLs (5-10 minutes). I also added MongoDB indexes on 
frequently queried fields (userId, createdAt) which reduced query times by 
50%. The result was a cache hit rate of 85%+ and the ability to handle 
500+ requests/second."
```

**Q: "Tell me about your architecture decisions"**
```
A: "I started with a Next.js monolith for rapid prototyping, but recognized 
the scalability limitations. I'm currently migrating to a Modular Monolith 
architecture with separate backend (Express) and frontend (Next.js). This 
provides better separation of concerns, independent scaling, and easier 
testing while avoiding the complexity of microservices. Each module (todos, 
posts, messages) follows a layered architecture: controllers, services, 
repositories - making it testable and maintainable."
```
