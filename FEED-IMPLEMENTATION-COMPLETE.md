## 🔐 Authentication Flow

```typescript
Client Request
    ↓
JWT Token in Cookie
    ↓
getUserIdFromRequest() in API Route
    ↓
Validate & Extract userId
    ↓
Proceed with Database Operation
```

**Client Side:**
```typescript
useAuth() Hook → Decodes JWT → Provides user object
```

**Server Side:**
```typescript
getUserIdFromRequest() → Verifies JWT → Returns userId or error
```
