## üíª Technical Details

### **Avatar Storage**

Currently using **base64** strings stored directly in MongoDB:

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ No external service needed
- ‚úÖ Works immediately
- ‚úÖ Simple implementation

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå Increases database size
- ‚ùå Slower for large images

**For Production**, consider:
- **Cloudinary** (easiest)
- **AWS S3** (scalable)
- **Vercel Blob Storage** (integrated)

---

### **Follow System Logic**

**When you follow someone:**
1. Your ID is added to their `followers` array
2. Their ID is added to your `following` array
3. Both users' counts update

**When you unfollow:**
1. Your ID is removed from their `followers` array
2. Their ID is removed from your `following` array
3. Counts update accordingly

**Validations:**
- ‚ùå Can't follow yourself
- ‚ùå Can't follow same user twice
- ‚ùå Can't follow without being logged in

---
