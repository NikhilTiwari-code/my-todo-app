## ⚠️ Areas for Improvement

### 1. **Architecture - Monolithic Design** 🏗️
**Current Issue**: Next.js API routes mixed with business logic

```
❌ src/app/api/todos/route.ts        (API + Business Logic)
❌ src/app/api/posts/route.ts        (API + Business Logic)
❌ src/app/api/messages/route.ts     (API + Business Logic)
❌ Tight coupling between layers
❌ Hard to scale horizontally
❌ Difficult to test in isolation
```

**HR Perspective**: This is the **biggest blocker** for production at scale. Most companies would require refactoring before deployment.

**Impact**: -2 points

**Solution**: See "Modular Monolith Migration" section below ⬇️

---

### 2. **Testing Coverage** 🧪
**Current State**:
```
✓ Rate limiting tests (scripts/test-rate-limits.js)
❌ Unit tests (0%)
❌ Integration tests (0%)
❌ E2E tests (0%)
❌ No CI/CD pipeline
```

**HR Perspective**: Untested code is a liability. Production apps need >80% coverage.

**Impact**: -1.5 points

**Recommendation**:
```bash
# Add these to package.json
"test": "jest",
"test:unit": "jest --testPathPattern=__tests__/unit",
"test:integration": "jest --testPathPattern=__tests__/integration",
"test:e2e": "playwright test"
```

---

### 3. **Inconsistent Code Organization** 📁
**Issues Found**:
```
❌ Business logic in API routes (should be in services/)
❌ Some utilities in lib/, others in utils/
❌ Mixed naming conventions (todos.model.ts vs post.model.ts)
❌ No clear domain boundaries
```

**Impact**: -0.5 points

---

### 4. **Error Handling** 🚨
**Current State**:
```
✓ Basic try-catch blocks
⚠️ Inconsistent error formats
❌ No centralized error handling
❌ No error logging/monitoring (Sentry, etc.)
❌ Stack traces exposed in dev (should be hidden in prod)
```

**Impact**: -0.3 points

---

### 5. **Database Design** 💾
**Concerns**:
```
⚠️ No database migrations system
⚠️ Schema changes require manual coordination
⚠️ No seed data for development
❌ Missing indexes on some foreign keys
```

**Impact**: -0.2 points

---
